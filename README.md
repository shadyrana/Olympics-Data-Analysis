# Olympics-Data-Analysis

This dataset make us visualize how the Olympics have evolved over decades. It includes questions about the participation and performance of womem & men across the globe and also about different sports and events.

This is basically historic olympic dataset of olympics held for the first time in Athens 1896 to the latest Rio 2016 taken from kaggle. 

In this project I have done some exploratory data analysis to extract some useful insights from the data. I've used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization to do further analysis.

The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events) and the file noc_regions.csv contains 230 rows and 3 columns.
